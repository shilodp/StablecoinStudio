                Open Stable (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This
                Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect

                Stable. It does not apply to third-party sites or services you

            <ol>
                <li>To create and maintain your account.</li>
                <li>To operate, secure, and improve the Platform.</li>
                <li>
                    To perform KYC/AML checks and comply with legal obligations.
                </li>
                <li>To communicate about updates or issues.</li>
                <li>To protect against fraud, misuse, or security threats.</li>

            <h4>4. No Sharing with Third Parties</h4>
            <p>
                We do not sell or share your personal information with third
                parties for marketing or commercial purposes. We may disclose
                data only:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To trusted service providers who perform services for us
                    (e.g., cloud hosting, KYC verification) under strict
                    confidentiality obligations;
                </li>
                <li>
                    When legally compelled (court order, subpoena, or similar
                    process);
                </li>
                <li>To protect rights and safety of users or the Platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Security</h4>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and
                organizational safeguards designed to protect personal
                information. Nevertheless, no security system is impenetrable;
                use is at your own risk.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Data Retention</h4>
            <p>
                We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the
                purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention
                period is required or permitted by law.
            </p>
            <h4>7. Your Rights</h4>
            <p>Subject to applicable law, you may: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you;</li>
                <li>Request correction or deletion;</li>
                <li>Object to or restrict certain processing;</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Use the in-app support ticketing system within Open Stable to
                exercise these rights.
